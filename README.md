## 🎯 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Detect whether an image is real or fake  
- Assist in the fight against digital misinformation  
- Provide an interactive interface for real-time predictions

---

## ⚙️ Key Features

- Binary image classification (Real / Fake)  
- Simple and fast image upload interface  
- Real-time prediction feedback  
- Backend support for prediction and result handling

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Python**  
- **Deep Learning Libraries**  
- **Image Processing Tools**  
- **Frontend Interface** (using React js)

---

## 🚀 Usage

Users can upload an image and receive immediate feedback on whether the system classifies it as *real* or *fake*. The interface is clean and user-friendly, allowing even non-technical users to interact with the model.
